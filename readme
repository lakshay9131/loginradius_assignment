# Brute-Force Protected Login Application

## Overview
A full-stack login application with brute-force protection mechanisms, implementing both user-level and IP-level lockout systems.

## Accounts
admin@example.com , admin@1234 (password)
admin1@example.com, admin@1234(password)

## Features 

- User authentication with email and password
- User-level lockout: 5 failed attempts in 5 minutes → 15-minute suspension
- IP-level lockout: 100 failed attempts in 5 minutes → IP blocked
- Real-time feedback for blocked/suspended attempts
- MongoDB for persistent data storage
- React frontend with Vite
- Node.js/Express backend
- Unit tests for rate-limiting logic

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
```
3. Set up environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory
- Add `MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://a1234:FlONFhajTk9ANyqd@cluster0.jal7nac.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
- Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory
- Add `VITE_LOGIN_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login` or backedn url path 
4. Start the application:
```bash
cd server && npm start
cd client && npm run dev
```

## Architecture and Design Decisions
- **Frontend**: React with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express for simplicity and scalability.
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible schema and fast writes.
- **Security**: Bcrypt for password hashing, rate-limiting middleware for brute-force protection.
- **Rate Limiting**: Custom middleware tracks failed attempts in MongoDB, with time-based cleanup.
- **Deployment**: Render for free hosting, with separate frontend and backend services.

## Hosting Platform
- **Platform**: Render (https://render.com)
- **URL**: [To be provided upon deployment]
- **Configuration**:
  - Frontend: Static site hosting
  - Backend: Node.js service with MongoDB connection
  - Environment variables set in Render dashboard

## AI Usage Report
- **AI Tools Used**: Deepseek and grok used for code and struture tips.
- **AI-Generated Code**: ~80% of the code (basic React components, Express boilerplate, MongoDB schemas).
- **Fine-Tuning**: ~2+ hours spent refining AI-generated code (rate-limiting logic, error handling, tests).
- **Manual Code**: Custom middleware, test cases, and deployment scripts were manually written. Also review of code , debugging etc
```

## 3. Deployment
- Deployed on Render (URL to be provided upon deployment).
- Frontend: Static site hosting with Vite build.
- Backend: Node.js service connected to MongoDB Atlas.
- Environment variables configured in Render dashboard.

## AI Usage Report
- **AI Tools**: GitHub Copilot (code suggestions), ChatGPT (architecture planning).
- **AI Contribution**: ~30% (boilerplate code, basic components, schemas).
- **Manual Work**: ~2 hours refining AI code, writing custom logic (rate-limiting, tests, deployment).
- **Non-AI Parts**: Middleware, unit tests, deployment scripts, and final debugging.
